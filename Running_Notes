Day1:
------------------------
Kafka introduction, Messaging systems, installation steps,topic Â architecture and workflow, kafka role in devops and microservices

Zookeeper introduction,producer & consumer architectures,kafka from commandline,Spring boot with kafka,sample applications

Partions,message delivery and ordering,fault tolerance in kafka and Kafka tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEVOPS/MICROSERVICES/Cloud features

Automation

Service to service communication can be done in multiple.1 way is thru messaging services
Example:Kafka/rabbitmq/ActiveMQ/IBM mqSeries.......etc

ADvantage: can be used in composite webservices designing
2)It can be used in Microservices.
3)Kafka is one of the best tool for streaming.
4)Kafka is mainly used in data analytics.(Bigdata/Hadoop)
5)Kafka is used as a combination with Spark.
6)KAfka can be used in IOT(sensors)/Deep learning.
7)Kafka can be used in designming and implementing of Social networking sites whthere data flow is high.
8)Now a days is used in Feeds like RSS feeds.......

Dis:No proper verified tools for monitoring kafka,No exe,no more no of connectors for kafka(except confluent)


Why kafka? Speed/Accuracy/Fault tolerance/Policys implemted by kafka and good node management

befor HAdoop/big data; dealing with unstructured data is one the pain ful job.

 before Streaming architectures:There is no performacne in app where data is more.
 
 more Expense,labour cost
 
 Now:more automation,every thing is speed,we can handle huge amount of data.
 kafka  ---is not pure JMS tool
 TCP
 RABBIT MQ---HTTP/AMQP
 
 MIDDLEWARE SERVICES(messaging serrvice is also one middleware service):15 years ,we usually design middle ware services using CORBA.
 1 middleware service code is around 5---20lakh lines
 14*20lakhs
 
 All APP servers rproviding middleservice fatures by default.
 
 KAfka is one of the best Streaming distributed messaging tool.
 
 Messaging tools transfer data from one point to another point.
 
 Ex:MEssaging service tools.
 
Producer------>Consumer
 
Srinivas------>Kafka knowledge(data)------>learners r consuming
in srinivas brain.
 
 Messaging service:  KAfka is not database.
 kafka is not a IOT tool.iT is helper tool.  KAfka acts as a broker.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 java :Byte(1byte) vs char(2 bytes)
 
 will Byte transfer faster? or char will be transfered faster?
 
 IN streaming always bytes will be used.kafka uses streaming approach.
 
 Elastic search/Splunk/logstash....
 
 Example:Discover account/Willis Account(capge),Linkedin......
 
 
 S/w:JDk1.8,Chrome,Eclipse Luna/mars,mysql db(any version),7zip.
 
  transtive Dependency:Zookeeper for kafka.
 
 Spring Boot+Kafka
 KAfa app using java,Single node/multi node config,one microservice implementation.

Reqyuirement on kafka connector in microservices impl.Customer ESB buses.MuleSoft/Apache camel. 
zookeper port no:2181
